  <br>Oh love, you were a sickly child <br>
And how the wind knocked you down<br>
Put on your spurs, swagger around<br>
In the desperate kingdom of love<br>
Holy water cannot help you now<br>
Your mysterious eyes cannot help you<br>
Selling your reason will not bring you through<br>
The desperate kingdom of love<br>
There's another who looks from behind your eyes<br>
I learn from you how to hide<br>
From the desperate kingdom of love<br>
At the end of this burning world<br>
You'll stand proud, face upheld<br>
And I'll follow you into Heaven or Hell<br>
And I'll become, as a girl<br>
In the desperate kingdom of love.
